Potential Providers that are bidding independently for Lots 1 and or Lot 2 should not also bid for these Lots as a member of a Group of Economic Operators.

For the avoidance of doubt any Potential Provider that decides to bid both independently and as part of a consortia then the Authority reserves the right to exclude any bid where it has sufficiently plausible indications that the bid distorts competition. 
Crown Commercial Service reserves the right for an electronic auction to be held by Public Sector bodies during further competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement(s). 
The Authority reserves the right to Award all Lots or any combination thereof. The Lots may be awarded independently and at different times e.g. if the Authority were to be facing a potential challenge for Lot 4, the Authority would still award (following the conclusion of the mandatory standstill period) the other Lots. The Authority would then award Lot 4 at a later date.

Load of TEM data; iii. Reporting; iv. Inventory; v. Tariff optimisation; vi. Benchmarking. 5. Personal Call Management (subject to service 4 being taken); 6. Tactical Provisioning/Ordering (subject to service 4 being taken); 7. Contact Services (A professional service to contact users to confirm the status of devices, users and services where these are not known, allowing the TEM provider to build an accurate inventory where one does not exist, or the data held is not complete) (subject to service 4 being taken). One of the main objectives of this framework is to reduce public sector spend on telecoms by driving out waste and creating efficiencies of (at least) 20 % by deploying TEM to analyse and manage as much of this spend as possible. Crown Commercial Service is planning to hold a Supplier Information Day on Wednesday 8.3.2017 in London (details will be provided to registered parties). The purpose of this event is to describe our needs and seek market engagement and feedback to further develop our requirement. Please register your interest by contacting CCS via: E-mail: tem2@crowncommercial.gov.uk Telephone: +44 345 010 3503 Although the potential TEM functional categories have been included in this document, Suppliers should be aware that Crown Commercial Service may change both the scope, scale and the structure of the contract as a result of market and customer engagement. Crown Commercial Service cannot guarantee that a call for competition will definitely take place. All potential value figures stated in this document are estimates. Based on our current project plan, we estimate that we will publish the contract notice on or around the 30.5.2017.

— and reporting, including management information and provision of information to regulators and other bodies as needed. 
The tender documents will include more information on these requirements. 
Potential bidders' suitability to participate will be assessed using the Selection questionnaire (SQ). 
Following the initial evaluation, shortlisted potential bidders will be issued an Invitation To Tender (ITT), and invited to provide a tender outlining their proposed solution. Tenders will undergo evaluation and the Authority anticipates that no more than the top 6 bidders will be invited to attend a face to face session with the Authority. Once all bidders have attended their session, the Authority will issue a formal Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD). Bidders will be required to submit a formal response to the ITPD. The Authority will evaluate the ITPD, and down-select to those bidders it wishes to take in to Competitive Dialogue stage. The Authority anticipates that no more than 3 bidders will participate in the Competitive Dialogue stage. 
During the Competitive Dialogue stage, the Authority will reserve the right to down-select bidders that fail to meet the award criteria. At the end of the Competitive Dialogue stage all remaining bidders will be invited to present a subsequent tender. Following the Authority’s evaluation of such subsequent tender a preferred bidder will be selected. The Authority will then endeavour to finalise a contract with the preferred bidder. The Authority reserves the right to appoint a reserve tender during the preferred bidder stage with whom the Authority will endeavour to finalise a contract if the preferred bidder cannot stand up to their subsequent tender. 
The Authority reserves the right to invite additional potential bidders to tender in certain circumstances, for example if a shortlisted potential bidder withdraws from the procurement process. 
The award criteria will be on the sole basis of the most economically advantageous tender in terms of the tender representing the best price-quality ratio. The Authority envisages that the price-quality ratio will be approximately 30 (price) and 70 (quality) at initial tender stages and 45 (price) 55 (quality) at future down select and final evaluation stages as may be updated during the stages of the procurement process. It is envisaged that quality will encompass contractual compliance and appropriate technical solution and compliance with the technical requirements. 
Any contract or agreement resulting from the procurement process will be considered as a contract made in England according to English Law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. The Authority does not bind itself to award any contract nor does it bind itself to accept any tender.",,

This is the final of three modules which up to 100 delegates will attend in summer 2020.  This module will be run three times with around 30-35 delegates each time.

Module 3 will pull together the concepts of Modules 1 and 2, and continue to stretch the delegates by exposing them to the challenges and opportunities which public services will face in the future (the next 3-10 years) and how their leadership within their organisation and beyond is instrumental in addressing those challenges and opportunities. It will also be the final part of the programme to connect content and learning back to their real-world challenges.  Delegates should leave with a clear sense of the challenges and opportunities they will face at both an individual and organisational level over the next decade and tangible actions regarding what they will do about that by working together across sectors.

The CL1 ordering period was extended in early 2016 until 18 June 2017 as permitted under the CL1 Framework. The CL1 Framework allows Capita Business Services Ltd to continue to provide services for a 12 month time frame beyond the ordering period. As a result, CCS has invoked this contractual provision to ensure public sector customers have continuity of service while the procurement for the replacement framework is underway, and CL1 will continue until June 2018.

Crown Commercial Service (CCS) wishes to establish a Framework Agreement for the provision of Technology Expense Management (TEM) services for the benefit of UK public sector bodies, which include Central Government Departments and their Arm's Length Bodies and Agencies, Non Departmental Public Bodies, NHS bodies, Local Authorities, Health, Police, Fire and Rescue, Education, Charities and Devolved Administrations. 
The ‘competitive procedure with negotiation’ (regulation 29) process will used for this procurement. 
The Services covered by this Procurement will be divided into 2 Lots; 1 for Central Government and 1 for Wider Public Sector. This split will allow us to provide a closer focus on the 2 customer markets and allow greater on-boarding capacity for each customer market sector. There will be 1 supplier for each lot. 
The agreement duration under consideration is two years with flexible extension of up to a further 24 months. This is subject to change following further market engagement. 
The solution will be required to support the management of a variety of technology and telecoms services. 
A variety of TEM functions may be required (and could be separately ordered by the customer): 
1. Historical Billing Audit; 
2. Physical Audit; 
3. Snapshot; 
4. TEM: 
i. Database; 
ii. Load of TEM data; 
iii. Reporting; 
iv. Inventory; 
v. Tariff optimisation; 
vi. Benchmarking. 
5. Personal Call Management (subject to service 4 being taken); 
6. Tactical Provisioning/Ordering (subject to service 4 being taken); 
7. Contact Services (A professional service to contact users to confirm the status of devices, users and services where these are not known, allowing the TEM provider to build an accurate inventory where one does not exist, or the data held is not complete) (subject to service 4 being taken). 
One of the main objectives of this framework is to reduce public sector spend on telecoms by driving out waste and creating efficiencies of (at least) 20 % by deploying TEM to analyse and manage as much of this spend as possible. 
Crown Commercial Service is planning to hold a Supplier Information Day on Wednesday 8.3.2017 in London (details will be provided to registered parties). The purpose of this event is to describe our needs and seek market engagement and feedback to further develop our requirement. Please register your interest by contacting CCS via: 
E-mail: tem2@crowncommercial.gov.uk 
Telephone: +44 345 010 3503 
Although the potential TEM functional categories have been included in this document, Suppliers should be aware that Crown Commercial Service may change both the scope, scale and the structure of the contract as a result of market and customer engagement. Crown Commercial Service cannot guarantee that a call for competition will definitely take place. 
All potential value figures stated in this document are estimates. 
Based on our current project plan, we estimate that we will publish the contract notice on or around the 30.5.2017.
